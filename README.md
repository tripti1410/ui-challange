# ui-challange
UI code challenge.


## My comments
1. Used fontawesome for icons.
2. Not focused much on icon details like colors.
3. Did not implemented sub directory folder listing.
4. Not used any frameworks for css and js.
5. Typography created from my experience, colors not provided so used my own color scheme.
6. Ideally I would have modularized code into reusable js components like header, button, icons, card-estate-list etc. given more time.

## The task
The challenge is to achieve a responsive design as per the screens present in the assets directory. The screens are provided for 3 different resolutions. There is no need for implementing the undelying functionality.
